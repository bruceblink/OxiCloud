# application runs as the unprivileged "oxicloud" user (UID 1001).
# This script runs as root, fixes permissions, then drops privileges.

# entry is not already owned by that user. The storage volume is a
# content-addressable blob store that can hold millions of objects; a blind
# "chown -R" on every boot would re-stat and rewrite the inode of every blob,
# turning startup into minutes of disk I/O. Checking the root entry is the
# cheap idempotent guard: the first boot fixes a freshly mounted (root-owned)
# volume, and every later boot is a no-op.
